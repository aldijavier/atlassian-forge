# AI Agent Rules for jira-forge

## General Principles
- **Read AGENTS.md**: Before starting any task, read [AGENTS.md](file:///c:/Users/USER/vscode/jira-forge/AGENTS.md) for detailed coding standards and Forge-specific instructions.
- **Monorepo Context**: This is a monorepo. Always identify which app you are working on in `apps/`.
- **Forge CLI**: Always run `forge` commands from the root directory of the specific app (e.g., `apps/epic-breakdown`).
- **Pragmatism**: Prefer simple, vanilla JavaScript solutions using `@forge/react` (UI Kit).

## Directory Structure Overview
- `apps/epic-breakdown/`: Logic for story/task relations and breakdown management.
- `apps/prd-sync-guardian/`: Logic for synchronizing PRD documents with Jira issues.
- `apps/program-report/`: Logic for high-level program reporting.

## Coding Standards
- Use idiomatic JavaScript.
- Include verbose commentary for complex logic.
- **NO REACT DOM**: Only use components from `@forge/react`. Never use `<div>`, `<span>`, etc.
- **Table Usage**: Always use `DynamicTable`, never `Table`.

## Deployment & Verification
- Run `forge lint` before proposing a deployment.
- Use `deploy.sh` or `deploy-app-script.sh` for production deployments as per [COMPANY-DEPLOYMENT-GUIDE.md](file:///c:/Users/USER/vscode/jira-forge/COMPANY-DEPLOYMENT-GUIDE.md).
- Update the version number in the app's `package.json` or frontend code when making functional changes.

## Communication
- If a requirement is unclear, ask for clarification.
- Suggest alternatives if a feature is not natively supported by Forge.
