## Overview

Epic Breakdown is an internal tool developed by Terbang Ventures/Mekari for use within our Jira instance (jurnal.atlassian.net). This privacy policy explains how the app handles data.

## Data Collection

**What We Collect:**
- Jira issue data (Epic, Story, and Task information)
- User information (assignee names and account IDs)
- Sprint and board information
- Project metadata

**What We DON'T Collect:**
- No personal data is stored outside of Jira
- No external data transmission
- No tracking or analytics
- No third-party data sharing

## Data Storage

- All data remains within Atlassian's Jira Cloud infrastructure
- The app uses Forge platform APIs to read and write Jira data
- No data is stored in external databases
- No data is cached or persisted outside of Jira

## Data Access

- Only users with existing Jira access can view data through this app
- The app respects Jira's permission model
- Users can only see issues they have permission to access in Jira

## Data Usage

The app uses Jira data to:
- Display Epic hierarchies and breakdowns
- Enable inline editing of issue fields
- Create and link tasks to stories
- Update sprint assignments and status

## Security

- Built on Atlassian Forge platform with built-in security
- Uses Atlassian's authentication and authorization
- No custom authentication or user credentials stored
- All API calls use user context (asUser()) for permission checking

## User Rights

As this is an internal tool:
- You can stop using the app at any time
- All data remains in your Jira instance
- No data deletion is necessary as nothing is stored externally
